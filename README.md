# impress-presentation

A presentation done by a friend and I discussing programming languages as a topic.

N.B. Unfortunately only works in Chrome browser. The combination of impress.js with GSAP doesn't seem to agree with other browsers. If anyone has any fixes, feel free to suggest.

Cheers

# To run the application...

Just download the folder and open the index.html file in CHROME browser
